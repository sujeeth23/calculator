# ðŸ”¢ Simple Calculator â€“ HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a basic calculator I built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Itâ€™s a simple web app that can handle basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

I created this project to practice my frontend development skills and get more comfortable working with JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
